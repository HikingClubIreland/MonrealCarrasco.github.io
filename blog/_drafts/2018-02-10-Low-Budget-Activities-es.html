      <strong>BE AWARE OF SCAMS AND FRAUD!!!</strong>
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.daft.ie/content/safetyonline.daft">Here</a> are some
      red flags for scams.
    </p>

<!--
      Many students tend to share accommodation, but be aware, they live 4-5
      in one bedroom, and some houses have 15+ students living in 3-4 bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option is to rent your own flat/studio/apartment/house, if you
      have the enough funding to pay for it, it shouldn't be a problem. In theory
      if you live far away from the City Centre it's cheaper, but the reality
      in most cases is that it is the same or even more expensive because of
      transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would suggest to start looking for accommodation in sites listed below,
      and you might even add some alerts to get notifications to your e-mail.
      DO NOT TRY TO SECURE ACCOMMODATION FROM YOUR COUNTRY!!! There are too many
      scams and you must see the places first before paying for them.
      There are also Facebook Groups where you may find accommodation advertised
      by people moving from the place, just be aware of scams like I said before.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might find it difficult, because it is, but do not worry you will find
      a place to live, just do not say yes to the first just because you are
      scared you will not find something.
      When going to view a place, do not go with many people, landlords do not like
      party animals, and might confuse you with one. The viewings usually are open
      viewings, this mean there will be at least 30 more people trying to secure
      that accommodation, try not to feel the pressure.
      Be the first to call, to e-mail and to arrive to the place, show that you
      are interested but not desesperated.

After you have completed checking all of the above, you need to start preparing
for your trip.
First of all, everything will be just fine.
It might seem like you are going to be far away from home, from your friends and
family, but with the technology we currently have you will be able to talk to
them everyday, you will be able to keep in touch without a problem.
